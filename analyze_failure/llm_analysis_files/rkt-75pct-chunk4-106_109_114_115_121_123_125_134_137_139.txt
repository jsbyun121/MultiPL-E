As per my standing instructions, analyze each code-execution result provided. For every item, produce a structured report as follows.

1) Status
Status: "OK" (Success) or else (Failure)
Evidence: include exit code, error status, and whether stderr is empty/non-empty (quote the first relevant line).

If Failure (non-zero exit code, error status, or non-empty stderr)
Root Cause Analysis
Explain why it failed, grounded in the logs/trace.
Point to the exact faulty locations (file and line numbers if available). Quote the minimal offending snippets.
Recommended Fix (Minimal Patch)
Provide brief code segments (3–7 lines each) that would correct the issue.
If multiple faults exist, list fixes in order of impact.
Final Answer
Classify the ultimate source of failure as one of: faulty problem setting / wrong test case / incorrect code implementation.
State it on a single line: Final Answer: <chosen category>.

If Success (exit code 0 and empty stderr)
Critical Correctness Review
Do not assume success means correctness.
Check if the code's logic truly matches the intended problem requirements, including edge cases and corner conditions.
Identify any silent errors, logical flaws, or incompleteness that would still pass execution but fail semantically.
If the implementation is sound, explain why it is correct. If not, explain the discrepancy clearly.
Final Answer
Explicitly confirm or reject correctness in one line: Final Answer: correct or incorrect (with a one-phrase justification if incorrect).

General rules
Be precise and concise. Don't invent behavior not evidenced by the logs or code.
When line numbers aren't available, reference the closest identifiable code block.
Prefer minimal fixes over refactors; include just enough context to apply the patch.

;; You are given a rectangular grid of wells. Each row represents a single well,
;; and each 1 in a row represents a single unit of water.
;; Each well has a corresponding bucket that can be used to extract water from it, 
;; and all buckets have the same capacity.
;; Your task is to use the buckets to empty the wells.
;; Output the number of times you need to lower the buckets.
;; Example 1:
;; >>> (max_fill (list (list 0 0 1 0) (list 0 1 0 0) (list 1 1 1 1)) 1)
;; 6

;; >>> (max_fill (list (list 0 0 1 1) (list 0 0 0 0) (list 1 1 1 1) (list 0 1 1 1)) 2)

;;     * all wells have the same length
;;     * 1 <= grid.length <= 10^2
;;     * 1 <= grid[:,1].length <= 10^2

;;     * 1 <= capacity <= 10

;; Each row in `grid` represents a well; a 1 denotes one unit of water.

;; Given a positive integer n, return a sorted list that has the odd numbers in collatz sequence.
;; The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined
;; as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the 
;; previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of 
;; the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous
;; term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.
;; Note: 
;;     1. Collatz(1) is [1].
;;     2. returned list sorted in increasing order.
;; For example:
;; get_odd_collatz(5) returns [1, 5] # The collatz sequence for 5 is [5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1], so the odd numbers are only 1, and 5.

;; The Brazilian factorial is defined as:
;; brazilian_factorial(n) = n! * (n-1)! * (n-2)! * ... * 1!
;; where n > 0
;; For example:
;; >>> (special_factorial 4)
;; 288
;; The function will receive an integer as input and should return the special
;; factorial of this integer.
