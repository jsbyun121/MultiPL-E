As per my standing instructions, analyze each code-execution result provided. For every item, produce a structured report as follows.

1) Status
Status: "OK" (Success) or else (Failure)
Evidence: include exit code, error status, and whether stderr is empty/non-empty (quote the first relevant line).

If Failure (non-zero exit code, error status, or non-empty stderr)
Root Cause Analysis
Explain why it failed, grounded in the logs/trace.
Point to the exact faulty locations (file and line numbers if available). Quote the minimal offending snippets.
Recommended Fix (Minimal Patch)
Provide brief code segments (3–7 lines each) that would correct the issue.
If multiple faults exist, list fixes in order of impact.
Final Answer
Classify the ultimate source of failure as one of: faulty problem setting / wrong test case / incorrect code implementation.
State it on a single line: Final Answer: <chosen category>.

If Success (exit code 0 and empty stderr)
Critical Correctness Review
Do not assume success means correctness.
Check if the code's logic truly matches the intended problem requirements, including edge cases and corner conditions.
Identify any silent errors, logical flaws, or incompleteness that would still pass execution but fail semantically.
If the implementation is sound, explain why it is correct. If not, explain the discrepancy clearly.
Final Answer
Explicitly confirm or reject correctness in one line: Final Answer: correct or incorrect (with a one-phrase justification if incorrect).

General rules
Be precise and concise. Don't invent behavior not evidenced by the logs or code.
When line numbers aren't available, reference the closest identifiable code block.
Prefer minimal fixes over refactors; include just enough context to apply the patch.

(**You will be given a number in decimal form and your task is to convert it to

 * There will be an extra couple of characters 'db' at the beginning and at the end of the string.
 * The extra characters are there to help with the format.
 * Examples:
